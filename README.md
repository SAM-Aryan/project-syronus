    - Name
    - Registration Number
    - Year
    - Majors, Minors, Specializations
    - Uni - Email.
    - Course info / Timetable (Your time table will NOT be visible directly)
- You will also have the option of sharing additional details to make contacting you easier such as:

    - Twitter
    - Instagram
    - Github
- There will also be an option to see the list of students whose timetables overlap with yours.
    - There will be a slider to adjust the number of overlaps
